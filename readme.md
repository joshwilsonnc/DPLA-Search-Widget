An embeddable search widget to search the Digital Public Library of America collections.
It's written in pure JavaScript and CSS.  It has no external dependencies on libraries such as JQuery or Twitter Bootstrap.
Simply add the following to your page:

```html
<div id="dpla_search_widget"></div>
```

Then before the closing body tag add:
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="dpla-search-widget.js"></script>
```

You'll need to adjust the src path to wherever dpla-search-widget.js script lives on your server.
